# 5. Infrastructure
Track hosts, containers, processes, pods, and serverless functions. Quickly visualize your environment, identify outliers, detect usage patterns



## 5.1 Infra list
Ref: https://docs.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/list/

Infrastructure list shows all of your hosts monitored by Datadog with activity during the last 2 hours(default) and up to 1 week. Search your hosts, or group them by tags

## 5.2 Hostmap
Ref: https://docs.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/hostmap/

Host Maps visualize hosts together on one screen, with metrics made comprehensible through color and shape:

- Host maps enable you to see __distributions of machines in each of your availability zones__ (AZ)
- color of each host is set to represent the percentage of __CPU usage__ on that host, where the color ranges from green (0% utilized) to __orange__ (100% utilized)

__Filter by__ limits the Host Map to a specific subset of an infrastructure. The filter input bar in the top left enables filtering of the Host Map by tags as well as Datadog-provided attributes.


** Note: there is a distinction between filtering for tag:value and "tag:value"â€”filtering for tag:value strictly matches the tag, while filtering for "tag:value" performs a search on that text.



## 5.3 Container Map
Ref: https://docs.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/containermap/

You can see all of your containers together on one screen with customized groupings and filters, as well as metrics made instantly comprehensible through color and shape.

### GROUP BY FUNCTIONALITY AND FACETS
Ref: https://docs.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/livecontainers/?tab=helm#group-by-functionality-and-facets

You can also leverage facets on the left hand side of the page to quickly group resources or filter for resources you care most about, such as pods with a CrashLoopBackOff pod status.
